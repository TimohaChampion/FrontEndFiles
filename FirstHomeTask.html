   <h1>Romeo and Juliet </h1> 
<p></p>
   <h3>ACT 1</h3> 
    
   <h3>PROLOGUE</h3> 
    
    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
    <p> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
    <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
    <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
    <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
    <p> A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
    <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
    <p>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
    <p> The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
    <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
    <p>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</p>
    <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
    <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
    <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. </p>
    
    <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
    
    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
    
    <h4>SAMPSON</h4>
    
    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
    
    <h4>GREGORY</h4>
    
    No, for then we should be colliers.
